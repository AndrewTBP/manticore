Thank you for taking the time to consider contributing to Manticore. Please be aware that this is a hobby project. It is developered and maintained when I have the time, as a result it changes sporadically. 


### Data errors 

If you encounter bugs in the data please feel free to either make a note in the github issue tracker (https://github.com/brehaut/manticore/issues), or by making the correction to the datafile itself (static/data/bestiary.json) and making a pull request. If you opt to do the pull request, please run the test suite prior to making the request to ensure that you haven't made any errors.


### Bugs 

Please report bugs in the github issue tracker (https://github.com/brehaut/manticore/issues). Please mention the browser or browsers (and version numbers), operating systems or devices (and version numbers) in addition to the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. 

While I try to respond to bugs in a timely fashion please note that sometimes life gets in the road. 

Like with data errors, pull requests are welcome for bug fixes. If you are able to make a test case but cannot figure out how to make a fix yourself, I will gladly take a pull request for that. Please attempt to match the coding style of the piece of code you modify, and do not include any new dependancies. I am quite finickity about the code in the project, and may request changes before I accept your request; please do not be offended. As always, run the test suite before logging a pull request.


### Feature requests

Before making a feature request or pull request please look at the existing issues in the issue tracker. The 'Enhancement' label — https://github.com/brehaut/manticore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement — contains a list of all the features and improvements I am currently considering.

I prioritize features that will improve the quality of the generated results over other features. A feature that will significantly increase the overall complexity of the codebase, or the performance profile of the allocation algorithm are not likely to be accepted. 

Please do not start working on a pull request for a feature without first raising it as an issue. There is no garuntee it will be accepted. I will also be the fussiest about code style and quality for feature requests.
