We support and value the contributions of the wider Chaosium Tribe. We love to 
engage people with our mythic stories, and we want you to be able to share 
yours too! Our Fan Material Policy is designed to do just that while respecting
ownership of our copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual properties.

Copyright and trademark laws protect our property, and mean that people are 
generally prohibited from using our logos, images, or other trademarks or 
copyrighted content without our consent. This Fan Material Policy grants you 
permission to use some of our intellectual property under certain 
circumstances.

Chaosium and Moon Design Publications authorizes certain non-commercial use of 
the following material:

 * You may reference the names of things, institutions, places, people, 
   deities, and concepts from our published products, provided you make it 
   clear that these are our marks.
 * You may reference plots, storylines, language, and events from our 
   published products in campaign journals, play-by-post or play-by-email 
   games, internet discussion groups, or your own blog or website.
 * You may occasionally quote small sections of text, as long as you make 
   clear where the text is from. By “small sections” we mean up to a sentence 
   or two.
 * Fan fiction is fine, just don’t retell one of our own stories in your 
   words, make up your own!
 * Likewise fan art is fine, but use our art for inspiration, not for 
   direct copying.
 * You may use artwork or maps published on the Chaosium.com and Chaosium 
   Pinterest page, unless a page specifically states that the text or artwork
   is not to be used. Use is based on these conditions:
 * Images can be resized, but must not be cropped, color adjusted, edited, 
   distorted, or otherwise modified.
 * Maps can be resized or cropped, but must not be color adjusted, edited, 
   distorted, or otherwise modified.
 * The following text must be placed legibly on or immediately adjacent to 
   the image or map: © 2017 Chaosium Inc.
 * We also encourage you to credit the artist/cartographer by name.
 * You may not use artwork, including maps, that have not been published on 
   the website or Tumblr page, although you may create your own interpretations of material presented in our artwork and maps (as long as these are original interpretations and not simple copies).
 * You may use the covers of any of our products. Product covers may be 
   resized, but not be cropped, color adjusted, edited, distorted, 
   or modified.
 * You may create your own versions of our character sheets, including 
   web-based character sheets that autofill or calculate numerical values.
 * You may create your own versions of our props and handouts.

Restrictions
 * Non-Commercial.
    * “Non-commercial” means you cannot sell or otherwise charge anyone for 
      access to content used under this Fan Material Policy.
    * If you make any commercial use of Chaosium/Moon Design Publications 
      Material, your rights under this Policy will be automatically 
      terminated, and any permission granted by this Policy will be 
      immediately revoked.
    * If we believe that you are in the publishing business, you are 
      considered to be a commercial user, and you are not granted any right 
      to use any Chaosium/Moon Design Publications Material under this Policy. (Commercial users must obtain a Commercial License.)
 * Non-Retail.
    * You cannot charge for access to your materials or site; nor can you 
      distribute your content through retail channels such as DriveThruRPG, 
      OneBookShelf, Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, App Stores etc (even if the 
      material is free).
    * You cannot use crowdfunding (e.g. Kickstarter) to seek funds to produce 
      your material: such activity is commercial, and you would need a 
      Commercial License.
    * You can however use indirect methods to monetize your content, such as 
      website advertising/banner ads, or a tip jar on your website. If you 
      use a Patreon support, your Chaosium content must be freely available 
      to all viewers, not limited to the subscribers.
 * Unofficial.
    * You cannot imply or claim that your material is “official”, or endorsed 
      or approved by Chaosium.
    * You cannot emulate Chaosium or Moon Design Publications “trade dress”, 
      including page templates, art styles or fonts.
 * Unbranded.
    * You are not permitted to use our logos.
 * No apps or downloadable software or virtual tabletops (VTTs).
    * Software, apps, and virtual tabletops (VTTs) including any item a user 
      would download, install, and/or run, are not included in the Fan 
      Material policy. If you wish to create such a resource, you will need 
      to apply for Commercial License. Note, web-based character generators 
      are fine; app based character generators are not.
 * No merchandise items using our copyrighted material.
    * The Fan Material policy specifically excludes your use of our 
      copyrighted material including artwork, images, logos, and maps on such 
      merchandise items as clothing and apparel, mugs, posters or other wall 
      art, cards, calendars, stickers, phones cases, laptop and tablet 
      sleeves, bags, home decor, stationery items, toys, and other consumer 
      items. If you are unsure about your item, get in contact with us.
